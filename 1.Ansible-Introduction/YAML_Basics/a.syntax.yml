# Example demonstrating YAML Syntax

# YAML uses indentation to represent data hierarchy and structure.
# Each level of indentation is represented by spaces.

# In Ansible, indentation is crucial for defining plays, tasks, and other elements correctly.
# Incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors.
